# Motif Project

Motifs are short, recurring patterns in DNA that are presumed to have a biological function.
This project involves developing a "motif finding" program.  

The project consists of 2 components:
- Dataset Generator (Including the ability to inject noise into motifs)
- Motif Finder Program (3 different algorithm variants have been implemented)
